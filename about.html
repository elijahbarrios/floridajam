                                The Florida Jam is a new outreach project for youth, sponsored by the Florida State Fiddlers Association. This program is focused on teaching youth (children under the age of 18) traditional old time, blue grass and Celtic music. We offer group workshops and jams at community centers and area venues and we welcome everyone to participate!

                                <br>Currently, we have 2 pilot projects going - one in South Florida and one in North Florida, and we hope to expand across the state in the future. We are thankful to have support for our Tallahassee programs from the city of Tallahassee, Leon County, and COCA.

                            Andy Martin earned his bachelor's degree in music education from Florida State University.  He has been playing banjo for over 40 years and has shared the stage with artists such as David Grisman, Del McCoury, Tony Rice, Blue Highway, and The Steep Canyon Rangers.

                        <p>
                            Alyssa is a college student pursuing a bachelor's degree in Violin Performance at FSU. Originally from Cocoa, Florida, she began playing violin and taking violin lessons when she was 10 years old, although she did not start with classical music. She started learning folk, Old Time, and Celtic music, which has allowed her to meet numerous friends she is thankful to call family. She fell in love with music from attending music festivals as a kid, where numerous musicians would all come and play, jam, and spend time with one another. Music festivals exposed her to a world of like-minded individuals all coming together out of love, dedication to music, and this desire to share experiences with each other. This sense of community greatly impacted her, giving her a home away from home, and ultimately led to her decision to pursue music as a career.

                    She has always been like a sponge - soaking up and learning whatever tune she hears, and she is always looking to continue expanding not only the genres she plays, but also her repertoire within each genre. She thoroughly enjoys playing old time and other folk genres because of the artistic freedom she has to arrange tunes in new and interesting ways, in which she can experiment with different ornamentations, rhythms, dynamics, and more. Additionally, jams are an essential part of this genre, and this is one of her favorite parts of old time. These jams can go late into the night at festivals, and there is something so special to her about people making music with one another for hours on end.

                    She believes it is extremely important to appreciate all kinds of music and wishes to pass on her passion for multiple genres to others. Playing both folk genres and classical music has helped her greatly in her musical career, as they have allowed her to develop an extremely proficient ear and technical skills that she uses every day when playing and performing all kinds of music. Her goal is to make music accessible to all, and to advocate diversity and inclusion in everything she does. She wants to inspire others to pursue whatever music they love, and to always be open minded and accepting of all genres.

                    When she is not playing music, she enjoys being active in any way she can and staying busy in creative ways, whether that is learning new skills like juggling, or going on hikes in places she’s never been before. Other interests include camping, being outdoors, gaining new experiences, and making memories with others
